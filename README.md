# phase1-project-pokedeck
This project was made in collaboration by Colleen Cabedo, Erik Russell, and Dovid Edelkopf.
We had the idea to make a mock "Pokedex" to showcase our ability to access information from an API, update the DOM, and use event listeners to create a dynamic webpage.
We built our API to include a sample of 10 Pokemon for demonstrative purposes. Each Pokemon has keys for relevant information including id, name, image, description, and comment.
On our webpage, the user is able to navigate to view different Pokemon - either by choice or at random - and leave a comment on any particular pokemon's page.
We built our CSS using bootstrap.
